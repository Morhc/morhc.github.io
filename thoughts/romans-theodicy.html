    <h4>Reading Romans as Theodicy</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2025-04-21">April 21, 2025</time></p>

    <p>
    What is the book of Romans? Is it a Calvinist slam dunk or is there a better way to read it? 
    Everyone that I know who reads the book seems to think that the book is all about predestination and God's wrath and soverignty.
    But I think that idea can and should be problematized. The Reformed reading wants it to be about God's justice, but I think it's about His justice in a very different way.
    </p>
        <blockquote>
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3.3-4</a>: 
            What if some were unfaithful? Will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? By no means! Although every human is a liar, let God be proved true, as it is written,
            “So that you may be justified in your words
            and you will prevail when you go to trial.”
        </blockquote>
    <p>
    The book of Romans is concerned with God's justice, but not in the sense of God dealing out wrath. 
    It is asking how God can be just while people are violating the Law and that He has abandoned His covenanted Jewish people.
    This mindset completely changes how we ought to read the book.
    The opening two chapters are not about who God is going to deal out wrath on, but Paul framing the problem. 
    In chapter 1, Paul explains that God has not condemned the gentiles for their sins (in some very harsh words).
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 1.28, 32</a>: 
        And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them over to an unfit mind and to do things that should not be done.
        They know God's decree, that those who practice such things deserve to die, yet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Certainly in Paul's context, the open question is why has God allowed these wicked gentiles to impede on the autonomy of the Jewish people and when He will enact His justice.
        One of the reasons that Paul cares is because he's really shaped by Deutro-Isaiah's Suffering Servant who is supposed to bring justice to the earth and teach the nations the way of God.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2042&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 42.4</a>: 
        He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth, and the coastlands wait for his teaching.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        If the suffering servant, who is the remnant of Israel returning after the exile (see Isaiah  41.8-9; 44.1,21; 45.4; 48.20, 49.1-6), hasn't established justice in the earth then... God's servant has failed and the expectation of Deutro-Isaiah is for naught.
        But Paul is not willing to accept that because that would mean that God is not faithful to His people and promises.
        This poses a problem for Paul's doctrine of God: if God is just, then why has He allowed the gentiles to continue in their sin and why has He abandoned His covenant people?
        His answer to this theodicy is one of natural consequence: they ignored God so He left them to their devices.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In the next chapter, Paul turns the blame upon the covenant people who were meant to be the suffering servant bringing light.
        <i>All</i> who violate the Law are found wanting and cannot be justified by it.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 2.12-13</a>: 
        All who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged in accordance with the law.
        For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in God's sight but the doers of the law who will be justified.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Paul wants to defend that the Law is good and just because it comes from God, but he also has to deal with the fact that adherence to the Law in the community has failed to bring justice to the nations.
        It's not a statement on one's ability to uphold the Law, but a sober reflection on what is happening in front of him.
        People are simply not keeping the Law.
        Thus comes Paul's first lament in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3.9-20</a>. 
        It is <i>not</i> a declaration on man's ontological inability to do good (like those who uphold total depravity say), but an honest assessment of the situation.
        No one is following the Law, and thus no one is justified by it and God is leaving people up to their own problems.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        But this is definitely not a satisifying story for Paul who expects God's purposes not to fail and for the Isaianic expectation to be fulfilled.
        This is how Jesus figures into the story for Paul. 
        The rest of this book is Paul's answer to the theodicy of evil gentiles and a wayward people starting in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3.21-22</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been disclosed and is attested by the Law and the Prophets, 
        the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ for all who believe.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Notice what Paul is saying here.
        He is not saying that Jesus is a shield from God's wrath, and honestly Paul is not necessarily imposing justification right away.
        He is saying that God reveals the fact that He is just and righteous via the faith of Jesus Christ.
        God manifests a solution to theodicy in the person of Jesus Christ, principally in His death and resurrection. 
        This is why the law is not overturned by the death of Jesus.
        God has manifested His justice for both the Jewish person and gentile by the death of Jesus because God is God of both and in manifesting His righteousness in Jesus He does so for both.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The rest of the book is just pulling out the implications of this.
        Chapter 4 is about establishing historical continuity with the Abrahamic covenant.
        Chapter 5 is about how God manifests His Love to us in Christ's death and resurrection and claims our whole lives.
        Chapters 6-8 is about how humanity was enslaved by the cosmic powers, namely Sin, but God has freed us from that bondage through Christ sharing in our humanity.
        Chapters 9-11 are about how God has not abandoned His covenant, but expanded it to be inclusive of the gentiles (and all people). Here again we delve into Paul's answer to theodicy: God can do whatever He wants and He wants to have mercy on all.
        And then of course chapters 12-16 are him expanding on the ethics of the situation we are now in.
        Paul and the Judaism of his day expected that the Law is sufficient to save us from Sin, but he discovered by his revelation of the ascended Christ that that was not the case.
        For Paul, the Law was insufficient to save us from Sin because it was used by Sin as a weapon against us 
        (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 7.11</a>), 
        but God has sidestepped the Law in Jesus by joining in our condition of enslavement and freeing us
        (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8.3-4</a>).
        When Paul recognized the failures of the Law, that created a significant theological problem for him. How is God just then? Has He abandoned His people?
        The answer is No! God has not abandoned His people, and in fact He has expanded His covenant to include all.
