    <h4>Counter Apologetics</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2026-02-16">February 16, 2026</time></p>

    <p>
        New day, same old apologetic arguments.
        I just saw some stuff from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOC6VF6wSuE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Frank Turek</a> that I thought is fairly representative of the evangelical obsession with apologetics. 
        On the outset, I need to say this: (1) apologetics is bad (2) you don't need to have an explanation for the apologist, because it may be that the cutting edge of scientific inquiry hasn't settled an answer and (3) the apologist will regularly appeal to science and logic and reason, but they genuinely do not care about scientific inquiry and they are completely uneducated since evolution is still a scary word to them.
        Also I want to say that this whole video is just propagnda for the fascistic USA government and their ICE secret police that are terrorizing marginalized communities. 
        On that note, let's dive into the ten things that definitely make Christianity true.
    </p>
    <p>
        1. <u>The creation of the universe</u>: So the average evanglical apologist wants to establish something like Genesis 1 as historical reportage. 
        The slightly more intelligent will argue that according to the Kalam cosmological argument, the universe must have a cause -- which they assert is a powerful disembodied mind that they further assert is God.
        The lay apologist obviously can be laughed out of the room because half the time they think that the universe is only 6000 years old.
        The philosophically oriented apologist, however also can be easily rebutted knowing the scientific consensus around the start of spacetime.
        The consensus opinion is that the universe started as a singularity, and that prior to that our current understanding of physics breaks down.
        So there is no scientific consensus that the universe even started.
        <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo244963115.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cutting edge models</a> suggest that the energy that made up our universe must be pre-eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. <u>Fine-tuning of the universe</u>: The arugment here is that the constants in physics are tuned to a pretty fine margin to allow for the existence of life to emerge. 
        However (1) we haven't fully explored particle physics and there are a lot of questions being researched there and (2) if the universe we live in weren't tuned for life then we wouldn't be here to ask the question.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. <u>The creation of life</u>: Apologist have a hard-on for the origin of life stuff without having read a single paper on the subject.
        I am pretty sure this is an on-going research field that hasn't reached consensus, but just read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> at least, and you will see that it is completely scientifically understable independent of any supernatural explanation.
        The issue apologists have with this and the next point is that imagine that things pop in and out of existence fully formed, rather than thinking in large timescales and gradual processes with a lot of trial, error, and gradation. Also they're scared of even simple pop science books.
        They'll say "it just can't do that" but... it can.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. <u>Creation of new life forms</u>: I think this one is just an assertion that Genesis 1 is historical reportage and that they don't know what evolution is.
        Because..... evolution is how you get multiple new life forms from a common ancestor.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. <u>Consciousness</u>: The idea here is you have an immaterial soul that is the source of the thinking and identification of the self.
        With this there is some assertion that molecules can't just produce consciousness, but why not.
        Emergent properties of complex systems are a thing, and consciousness is just one of those things.
        When you think about a handful of objects, sure there are some things that don't happen, but when you have an unfathomable number of molecules and interactions, then you get all sorts of bulk properties of the system that you wouldn't expect just by looking at the individual parts.
        There are billions and billions of neurons in the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
        6. <u>Laws of logic</u>: I think the point of this argument is for you to say "wow God must exist because an apple isn't a pear". 
        Which might sound trite, but really the point is that the laws of logic are just a description of how we come to understand and process information about the world.
        The law of non-contradiction comes out of the fact that we can distinguish between things.
        The law of identity comes out of the fact that things are the things that they are.
        The law of excluded middle is that something either is or isn't.
        It's not magic rules that we are bound to obey of a supernatural being, it's simply our sense perception abstractized a bit. 
    </p>
    <p>
        7. <u>Laws of mathematics</u>: This argument really misses the mark and doesn't understand what mathematics and science are. 
        The argument is that we can describe the universe very well with mathematics.. which somehow means God.
        But the thing is, that we describe the universe with an abstracted representation of scientifically observed phenomena.
        The reason that "math is good at explaining the world" is because we are pretty good at describing the world with math.
        It's not some magic language that God gave us, it's literally just a conceptual tool that has been developed for thousands of years to help us count beans efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
        8. <u>The moral law</u>: The argument is that we have a sense of morality, and that this is evidence for God who is the source of our morality.
        But our sense of morality is just a product of our evolutionary history and our socialization.
        Whether you like that or not, that's just the way it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        9. <u>Old Testament prophecy</u>: Any argument that Jesus is predicted by Hebrew Scripture is literally just acknowledging that the Jewish New Testament writers who wanted Jesus to be the Messiah were Jewish and wrote the story about Jesus in a way that made him fit the mold of the Jewish Messiah.
        It's not evidence of anything except story telling.
    </p>
    <p>
        10. <u>The character of Jesus, the evidence for His resurrection, and Him becoming the unparalleled most influential person in history</u>: I'm sorry if you've been bored to tears so far, but we're almost there.
        (1) Jesus' character is portrayed to us by people who wanted to Him to look good. 
        Also something I have been thinking about for a while is all these people that are like "wow Jesus, Mohammad, Buddha, etc are such good moral teachers" but like a lot of the stuff is just "be a good person". 
        It's not like mind-blowing.
        (2) There is no evidence for the resurrection. Whether you believe it's an event in history is not grounded on evidence, but an internal conviction.
        (3) Popularity is not evidence of anything, especially when Christianity was the state of religion of the global hegemonic powers for millenia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, that's all. Just wanted to get that off my chest.
