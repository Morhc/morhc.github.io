    <h4>Doubts of Resurrection</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2025-12-17">December 17, 2025</time></p>

    <p>
        I find the level of doubt surrounding the resurrection of Jesus in the gospel narratives to be extremely interesting.
        I just have no idea why it's preserved in the text, but it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before we start though, I want to say is that gospels are not historical reportage of eyewitness testimony.
        They are first and foremost theological texts written for or reflecting the beliefs of communities of faith.
        This becomes really obvious if you read the non-canonical gospels this becomes really obvious.
        Each early Christian community had its own beliefs and practices of worship, and they produced their own texts to reflect and support them.
        Mark's community is obviously one that believes in ἀποκάλυψις and the unveiling of God's kingdom.
        Jesus' obsession with preserving a secret identity, that He preaches in mysteries to hide the truth of His teaching, and only unveils His veiled identity to a select few -- these are all hallmarks of a mystery cult that believes they have access to secret γνῶσις that saves.
        The gospel of Mark is no different than the gospel of Thomas or Judas or Mary or Phillip in this regard.
        Three differences between Mark and those gospels are (1) Mark's Jesus teaches the secrets to the whole inner circle rather than a particular disciple (2) Mark's narrative clearly is more developed and (3) the one for whom the secrets are fully unveiled and taught are the readers of the gospel itself.
        <i>Let the reader understand</i>.
        The gnostic nature of Mark and its community is lost to us when we place it by Matthew and Luke, but then again with John the whole salvation by secret knowledge thing comes out again.
    <p>
        Anyways, after that long preamble, let's get on with doubting the resurrection.
        Starting with the gospel of Mark, it ends with not a doubting of the resurrection but a complete lack of it.
    </p>        
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Mark 16.1-8 (NRSV)</a>:
        When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. 
        And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. 
        They had been saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?” 
        When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back. 
        As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. 
        But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. 
        He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him. 
        But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.” 
        So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Because of the veiled nature of Mark's gospel, it does not reveal Jesus risen to us in the text. 
        There is no appearance of Jesus, simply the declaration that He will meet where He has promised to meet them.
        Since the reader has already been inducted into the Jesus mystery cult, the text is an ἀποκάλυψις of the risen Jesus to them.
        On the literal level, the text says the ἀποκάλυψις of Jesus will occur for the disciples in Galilee, but considering the emphasis on the reader in Mark perhaps this serves as a reference to them that the ἀποκάλυψις occurs within their community.
        Think too about the women's reaction: silence.
        They tell no one.
        Where does the γνῶσις of risen Jesus come from then (asking with caution that we not read this text as historical report)?
        It comes from the community's ἀποκάλυψις of the risen Jesus.
        Mark's narrative veils Jesus from his contemporaries, but unveils Him to the reader, just as a certain young man is literally veiled and then unveiled.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2015&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Mark 15.51-52 (NRSV)</a>:
        A certain young man was following him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth. They caught hold of him, but he left the linen cloth and ran off naked.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Is this a coy reference to the reader who sees what is thinly veiled in the text that is fully unveiled once the Passion begins?
        While thinking about the naked man leaving his linens behind, let's think again about the other young man dressed in his white linens.
        The passage tells us a young man (not an angel, more likely a stand-in for the teachers in the Markan community who decode the mysteries of Jesus' γνῶσις for those listening, or maybe it is Jesus Himself) who declares Jesus is ἠγέρθη (risen/awaken), not ἀνάστασις (resurrected/transformed).
        While Mark clearly is working with a fresh concept of an empty tomb (one not found in Paul), he does not seem to agree that Jesus was resurrected as Paul does.
        Paul uses ἀνάστασις and ἔγερσις in the same sentence, but they are not the same thing and we have to be careful here.
        Perhaps Mark really does not believe in transformative resurrection, or maybe there is some play on awaking to the truth of γνῶσις.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that things are sufficiently veiled to us, let us move on to Matthew the copycat and his straightforward doubt of Jesus' resurrection.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Matthew 28.1-10, 16 (NRSV)</a>:
        After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. 
        And suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. 
        His appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow. For fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men. 
        But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. 
        He is not here, for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. 
        Then go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.' This is my message for you.” So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples. 
        Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. 
        Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers and sisters to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”... 
        Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. When they saw him, they worshiped him, but they doubted.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In the gospel of Matthew we find a copied version of Mark that is more mythological.
        Our ambiguous young man is now an angel descending from heaven with earthquakes and lightning striking down Romans with his aura.
        We also find that the ending of Matthew's gospel is just "the long ending of Mark" as it clears up that the women really did go and tell the disciples and Jesus really did meet with them and everything.
        There is no veiling here any longer. 
        The text really wants you to know that Jesus has been raised (once again, not resurrected but raised).
        We have a scary angel figure declare that Jesus is risen and to tell the disciples to meet Him in Galilee, then as they are leaving Jesus shows up and tells them that He's risen and that the disciples should be told to meet Him in Galilee.
        Like how indelicate and redundant can you get?
        Then we finally get to go to Galilee in the text and meet the risen Jesus and listen to Him -- but not before we learn that the disciples doubt what they see.
        It says they saw Him, worshipped Him, and doubted Him.
        This is a very strange combination of actions.
        How can they see Him and worship Him and still doubt that He is alive.
        Maybe Matthew is preserving an early memory that not all disciples believed in a risen Jesus and gave up the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's now go to Luke who ramps up the doubts, and has Jesus revealed twice in eucharistic meals to dispel the questions.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Luke 24.1-16, 30-43 (NRSV)</a>:
        But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices that they had prepared. 
        They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in they did not find the body. 
        While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them. 
        The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here but has risen. 
        Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be handed over to the hands of sinners and be crucified and on the third day rise again.”
        Then they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. 
        Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles. 
        But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. 
        But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.
        Now on that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. 
        While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him...
        When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?” That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. They were saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!” Then they told what had happened on the road and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread. While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”
        They were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost.
        He said to them, “Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? 
        Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see, for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.” 
        And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 
        Yet for all their joy they were still disbelieving and wondering, and he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?” 
        They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate in their presence.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Luke, taming mythological Matthew but keeping things dazzling, has three declarations of the risen (definitely not resurrected, He has flesh and blood) Jesus.
        First we have our two dazzling men tell the women that Jesus is risen (without Jesus telling them again immediately after, also transforming "meet Him in the Galilee" to "He told you in the Galilee He'd be raised again"). 
        The women tell our group of apostles (which is larger than just the eleven but includes their "companions") who do not believe their "idle tale" (a symptom of their sexism?).
        Peter, curious enough, checks things out and sees that the tomb is empty and presumably holds this privately as evidence and goes home amazed.
        Then as two of this group of apostles are walking and encounter the risen Jesus who is revealed in a eucharistic meal.
        Then they go to the eleven and their companions (our group of apostles from earlier, note that this all is on the same day) and they exclaim "The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!".
        That is super weird. 
        They go tell the eleven (and companions!), but it says Peter went home not back to the group. 
        They tell them they saw a vanishing Jesus and they believe their testimony immediately (as opposed to disbelieving the women).
        And they celebrate that Jesus has appeared to <i>Simon</i>
        Uhm, no? 
        There is no encounter of Simon Peter and the risen Jesus.
        Peter sees an empty tomb and is amazed and that's it.
        (And if we are to believe "Simon" is one of these two walking to Emmaus then why not say name the walkers and why celebrate that 1/2 of them saw Jesus?).
        Maybe this preserves an early memory that there were never group appearances but simply a private appearance to Peter that transformed him.
        Perhaps "The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!" is an early creed that lacks the accretions of Paul's creedal statement of 1 Corinthians 15.3-7.
        Whatever the case may be, Luke wants us to know that Jesus showed up to the rest of them as a group in the moment of celebrating the appearance in eucharist.
        But they still doubt!
        They think He is a ghost!
        They see Him, talk to Him, <b>touch Him</b> and still doubt.
        It seems that the thing that really pushes them to believe is another eucharistic meal of fish.
        Once again we have an even more extreme form of doubt than Matthew's disciples.
        Because in Matthew they saw, (heard), worshipped, and doubted.
        Here they see, (hear), worship, <b>touch</b>, and doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, we come to John's multiple endings and appearances that is anti-doubt.
        Rather than directly putting nearly two full chapters, I'll just summarize:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mary sees an empty tomb and is distraught as this time John left her without another to accompany her and without an angel to mansplain the situation</li>
        <li>She tells Peter and the beloved disciple its empty, who race over and figure it out by deduction that Jesus must've been raised from the dead (clearly John here is embellishing on Luke's account of Peter checking it out by adding the audience of the gospel as the one who clues in like Mark [that's my take on the beloved disciple anyways])</li>
        <li>Then Mary is the first to encounter risen (not resurrected, but for John maybe they mean the same thing) Jesus</li>
        <li>I think it's really weird that Jesus does not ascend in Mark or Matthew and no narration of ascending in John</li>
        <li>Then we have a repeat of Luke's appearance to the disciples but without doubts, touching, eucharistic elements, or Thomas</li>
        <li>Thomas then is the only one who doubts the raising of Jesus, but this is cleared up a week later (without touching)</li>
        <li>Thomas' doubting of courses exists only for the reader as Jesus tells those listening to the gospel being read out loud that they are blessed for believing (not doubting!) without seeing</li>
        <li>Then we get the second ending of the gospel where the eucharistic fish of Luke shows up finally in another appearance (strangely considering no one doubted, they <i>knew it was the Lord</i>)</li>
        <li>And then we perhaps get a final nod towards the community who is listening to the gospel being read: "If it is my will that he [the beloved disciple] remain until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!"</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        John just does not entertain doubts.
        For him it is all about believing no matter what.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what are we supposed to make of all this?
        Mark's veiled secret knoweldge of a risen Jesus, Matthew's doubting worshippers, Luke's doubters who need eucharistic meals to believe, and John's anti-doubt propaganda.
        The problem of course is that I have no idea what to do ever.
        Maybe these narratives preserve for us early memories of a movement that struggled to believe in a risen Jesus.
        Maybe they reflect four ways to believe in a risen Jesus.
