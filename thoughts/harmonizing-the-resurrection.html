    <h4>Harmonizing the Resurrection</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2026-02-02">February 2, 2026</time></p>

`    <p>
        Apologists will claim that the gospels are four different perspectives of the same event, and that if you just pay attention to the narrative details, they will be perfectly harmonizable.
        Now, <a href="doubts-of-resurrection.html">I don't think that's true at all</a>, but let's grant it and actually just do it.
        Time to repeat Tatian's error of creating the Diatessaron for the discovery of the empty tomb.
        I will reproduce all of Mark's gospel as the base text since it was written first and leave out non-consequential differences.

He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus's head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself.

        These are just not minor narrative differences, but completely different stories about the same event. 
        What are inerrantists wanting us to believe here?
        It makes absolutely no sense to try to harmonize these accounts.
        Something else that I want to add to this conversation is the account in the Gospel of Peter, which was likely written within 50 or so years of the canonical gospels.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospelpeter-brown.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Gospel of Peter v. 50-57</a> Now at the dawn of the Lord's Day Mary Magdalene, a female disciple of the Lord (who, afraid because of the Jews since they were inflamed with anger, had not done at the tomb of the Lord what women were accustomed to do for the dead beloved by them), having taken with her women friends, came to the tomb where he had been placed. And they were afraid lest the Jews should see them and were saying, 'If indeed on that day on which he was crucified we could not weep and beat ourselves, yet now at his tomb we may do these things. But who will roll away for us even the stone placed against the door of the tomb in order that, having entered, we may sit beside him and do the expected things? For the stone was large, and we were afraid lest anyone see us. And if we are unable, let is throw against the door what we bring in memory of him; let us weep and beat ourselves until we come to our homes.' And having gone off, they found the sepulcher opened. And having come forward, they bent down there and saw there a certain young man seated in the middle of the sepulcher, comely and clothed with a splendid robe, who said to them: 'Why have you come? Whom do you seek? Not that one who was crucified? He is risen and gone away. But if you do not believe, bend down and see the place where he lay, because he is not here. For he is risen and gone away to there whence he was sent.' Then the women fled frightened.

        This account is something that can be harmonized, particularly with Mark's gospel.
        The only unique details are some comments about Mary's fear, some extra dialogue on the way to the tomb, and the extra detail that the young man is wearing a splendid robe and was comely.
        If this crazy early text can be harmonized with Mark and the other canonical accounts cannot, then what does that say about them?
        Certainly not that they are inerrant historical accounts from differing perspectives.
        Anyways, this was a fun exercise to do, and I hope you enjoyed it and realize that all conservative theologians are full of it for most (if not all) of their claims.
