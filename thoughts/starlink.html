    <h4>The Price of Faster Internet is Astronomy</h4>

        <b>What is Starlink?</b> 
        Elon Musk's company Starlink started launching satellites in 2019 to connect every region of the world with high-speed internet, no matter how remote. 
        5 years later, the availability map on the official website shows that about half of the world has coverage (the Western world + some of South America and a couple African countries). 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What's the difference from other satellites?</b> 
        The orbit of these satellites is in a different location than current full coverage GPS and internet satellites. 
        GPS is currently managed by 31 satellites at a semi-synchronous orbit (they orbit over the same location twice in one day). 
        Current satellite internet providers to Starlink place their satellites in geo-stationary orbits (from our perspective on Earth they sit still in the sky). 
        There are a lot of advantages to this: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <item>1. More of the Earth's surface area can be seen from further away, so you need less satellites to get full coverage.</item>
        <br><item>2. Semi-synchronous and geo-stationary orbits are easily and reliably trackable at any given moment.</item> 
        <br><item>3. Having satellites far enough away from Earth's atmosphere means that times of high magnetic activity (like the Aurora Borealis) don't cause your satellites to fall out of the sky.</item>
    </ol>
    <p>
        However, there is a disadvantage to these orbits - their distance means that there is a noticeable time delay for communication. 
        This time delay is about half a second, which can be a problem for those who want extremely high internet speeds. 
        Elon, likely taking inspiration from satellites launched in the 90s, proposed Starlink as a solution. 
        Starlink satellites are at a much low-earth orbit, which is much closer with a significantly lower delay. 
        The trade-off is the number of satellites has to be significantly increased to make sure there is full coverage - there are 5289 in orbit out of the total planned 42000. 
        These satellites are much more difficult to track in the sky since there are so many and their orbits are much more random. 
        Further, they are low enough that you can see them with your eyes and for magnetic activity in the Earth's atmosphere to cause them to malfunction and fall out of orbit (hundreds have already).
        Starlink satellites also have 5-year lifetimes, and are designed to burn up in the atmosphere when they stop working. 
        Currently, Starlink makes up over half of the total 9360 satellites and alone are twice as many satellites than were in orbit in 2018. 
        Of course, Starlink is not the only company sending up these low-earth satellites now that “low-latency internet” is the new zeitgeist. 
        There are plans to 10x the number of low-earth satellites in the next 10 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What's happening to astronomy?</b>
        A massive concern for astronomers is that all of these satellites will seriously impede our ability to study the night sky. 
        All of these satellites produce signals, reflect sunlight, physically block starlight, and streak as they burn up - and we can see all of that in telescopes. 
        Starlink is leading the charge by being the densest coverage of the night sky we have ever seen. Kruk et al (2023) published in Nature that 2.7% of photos taken by Hubble have contamination from low-earth satellites and predict in the next ten years that up to half of photos that are taken will have contamination. 
        Vruno et al (2023) published in A&A that they found Starlink satellite signals interfering with the radio telescope LOFAR. 
        Having all these satellites will also increase the light pollution for the whole night sky, making it harder for astronomers to see stars, as already seen by authors like Nandakumar et al (2023) publishing their findings in Nature.
        One of the important criteria for building telescopes is that they are in more remote areas so that there is as little light and signal pollution as possible. 
        Starlink and its competitors are working hard to make sure that no part of the night sky will be left untouched by their satellites. 
        <br><br>
        As someone who studies astronomy and has been excited by the observational advances by telescopes like JWST, this is incredibly disheartening. 
        Without significant regulation from the governments of the world and restrictions on the number of low-earth satellites, observational astronomy will be permanently altered. 
        New discoveries require high precision measurements of hard to detect objects, and the explosive increase of low-earth satellites will serve as a serious hurdle, if not a complete blockade, to our ability to study them.
        Without observations, new astronomical theories can't be tested, and new objects can't be found. 
        On a more personal note, I grew up in the city and never went camping.
        On a clear night, I would see only a handful of stars at most. 
        The first time I went to a more remote area, I was overcome by how full the night sky could be. 
        With Starlink and other companies brightening the night sky, there will be less stars to see - even for those in the most remote areas of the world. 
        In our ancient past, people would look at the night sky and be in awe. 
        The Greeks were the ones to come up with the name of the Milky Way because it looked like there was milk poured out on the sky. 
        This is dim enough that even a full moon will wash it out. 
        I have never had the pleasure of seeing this sight (because I'm not much of a camper), but if the number of low-earth satellites planned are launched, it might mean no one sees it again. 
        We are being slowly severed from the night sky that we have had as humanity since our inception. 
        <br><br>
        I haven't touched on the other concerns that come along with launching tens of thousands of satellites into low-earth orbit.
        We are already having difficulty managing the space junk that is creating a dome of garbage that is blocking us in, and an explosion of new satellites in a region where failures are higher will increase this. 
        There are also climate concerns about the metals that these satellites will put in the atmosphere when they burn up (which they are designed to do every 5 years), and it is unclear how that will affect our air and rain.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>So what now?</b> 
        I don't know. But I ask this question: Is it worth it? 
        Is it worth sacrificing the night sky for the sake of faster internet. 
        Internet is already fast. We already have good coverage. 
        The main users of Starlink are rich people in cottages who want to stream Netflix faster. Who cares. 
        This isn't innovation. This isn't anything new. It's faster because they're putting it closer to us. 
        And how fast does internet have to be to make people happy? 
        Why is waiting half a second for a 4K YouTube video to stream too slow? 
        I personally think that the cost we have to pay is way too high. 
        There needs to be lots of regulation and restrictions on the number of low-earth satellites before it is too late. 
        We cannot allow for billionaire CEOs to profit off of faster internet at the cost of the sky.
