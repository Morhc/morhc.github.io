    <h4>Christian Agnosticism</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2025-03-06">March 6, 2025</time></p>

    <p>
    I have been playing around with the fun idea of Christian (1) agnosticism (2). What do I mean by this? Let's start with (2):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        I do not myself know of any argument for the existence of God which I find convincing; in all of them I think I can find flaws. 
        Equally, I do not know of any argument against the existence of God which is totally convincing; in the arguments I know against the existence of God I can equally find flaws. 
        So that my own position on the existence of God is agnostic. 
        (<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#DefiAgno" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        By the way, seriously recommend reading that article. 
        Pretty cool stuff there.
        I think that any epistemology of God's existence is fundamentally flawed. 
        How can anyone assert absolute belief in the existence of a God in a post-quantum physics age when <a href="https://medium.com/@itsjoshissa/a-quantum-critique-of-aquinas-4152a2af840ae" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aquinas is left silent</a>? 
        Let's quickly review all the arguments for God's existence, and even the rational proofs for the Christian God's existence. 
        Obviously it won't be exhaustive or in-depth, but I think a quick sketch is due:
        <ol>
            <li>Aquinas' Five Ways: <a href="https://medium.com/@itsjoshissa/a-quantum-critique-of-aquinas-4152a2af840ae" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See my Medium article on this</a></li>
            <li>Cosmological Argument: All cosmological arguments are rooted in interpretations of observational datum by non-scientists (bad start) and have always been proven to be misinterpretations (like WLC's "universe from nothing") or eventually a god of the gaps (Aquinas)</li>
            <li>Fine-Tuning Argument: I think this argument is ridiculous on its face and it's telling that non-physicists are the only people who talk about it.</li>
            <li>Ground of Self-Consciousness Argument: I profess I know the least about this one and I need to read David Bentley Hart's <i>All Things Are Full of Gods</i> - but I conjecture that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon and that some time from fetal to toddler state "we" suddenly gain the property of an un-escapable self-consciousness by interacting with the world and this is completely lost to us like Derrida's Trace because it's such an early state it's hard to experiental argue for. </li>
            <li>Moral Argument: You can construct logically consistent arguments for objective morality without appealing to God, see <a href="https://youtu.be/c78JWAAPZ_o?si=oIl5_bPZTiRnQmwH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> for instance. </li>
            <li>Historical Veracity of the Resurrection: You cannot rationally prove an act of God in history. That is outside the scope of the project of natural history.</li>
            <li>The Prophetic Nature of the Bible: You have to <i>a priori</i> accept that the prophecies are really prophecies about a specific future event which is impossible because there are zero that you can do that for internally in the OT and there is really not much clear cut that would apply to NT without a Christian re-interpretative framework which is only valid in a post-resurrection mindset.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        I am not saying all this to say that I am an atheist. Far from it, I am a Christian. Hence (1) in my <i>Christian</i> agnosticism.
        Following cues that I have picked up in the Reformed tradit ion, specifically from Bonhoeffer and Barth, it simply is just not possible to know God apart from the revelation of Jesus Christ (principally in the passion of Christ).
        Let's start with how the Synod of Dort defines total depravity in article 3 of its canons:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Therefore, all people are conceived in sin and are born children of wrath, unfit for any saving good, inclined to evil, dead in their sins, and slaves to sin.
        Without the grace of the regenerating Holy Spirit they are neither willing nor able to return to God, to reform their distorted nature, or even to dispose themselves to such reform.
        (<a href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/canons-dort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canons of Dort</a>)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Let's think about this a bit.
        If it is true that without the Holy Spirit we cannot return to God.
        How is it that we can ever know the true God? 
        Article 1 of the canons says that this state of estrangment from God is prior to our existence by placing the blame on Adam.
        So it's not that we as individuals can't return to the God we once knew, but that we can't return to the God that Adam as a proxy for humanity knew.
        Which means of course that it is a God that we have never <i>truly</i> known - especially if you accept that to know God is to encounter God.
        Let's now turn to the Institutes where John Calvin does argue that all people are born with an intution of God with very harsh language (III.1-3), but he makes an important distinction in II.1 that
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        I am not now referring to that species of knowledge by which men, in themselves lost and under curse, apprehend God as a Redeemer in Christ the Mediator. 
        I speak only of that simple and primitive knowledge, to which the mere course of nature would have conducted us, had Adam stood upright.
        (<a href="https://ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes/institutes.iii.iii.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institutes of the Christian Religion (I.2.1)</a>)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Why is this distinction from Calvin important? It's not just a distintion between general and special revelation. 
        He calls this a <i>primitive</i> knowledge of God that everyone has (because he feels committed to a particular reading of Romans 1), not an encounter with the presence of the true God.
        The only way for man to truly know God to know Him "as a Redeemer in Christ the Mediator". 
        And this is where the Barthian tradition comes in.
        This quote is exactly the whole point of all of Barth's theology.
        We can only ever know the true God in the revelation of Jesus Christ that God has freely acted in Love to save us.
        For Barth, only God can reveal Godself to us.
        God is veiled to us by God and God can only be unveiled to us by God.
        And where does the unveiling of God happen? 
        In the passion of Christ.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        We conclude from the reality Jesus Christ that God reveals Himself, that
        He is free for us, in such a way that God's Son or Word assumes a form at least
        known to us, such that He can become cognisable by us by analogy with other
        forms known to us. His humanity is the covering which He puts on, and therefore the means of His revelation. 
        We return at once to the fact that it is humanity. 
        But as such it is a form of being belonging to the cosmos, whose reality is
        also known to us in another way. God could have revealed Himself immediately, in His invisible glory. 
        Or in order to be manifest to us, the Word might
        have assumed the form of a being previously and otherwise wholly foreign to
        us, a being belonging to some other cosmos of reality. But that is not the case.
        As a mystery, revelation does not anywhere infringe the nature and history of
        our cosmos as we know them. Although with signs and wonders, things happen
        as they have always and everywhere happened since this cosmos began to exist.
        That is to say, at a definite point in space and time there lives and dies a human
        being like us all. In this human being God's Word is revealed to us... 
        God bends down to us as it were, by assuming this form familiar to us. His
        love is already announced to us in the fact that even in His veiling-in which He has first to be unveiled as God, to be believed in as God-He yet does not
        meet us as a stranger.
        (Church Dogmatics I.2/13.2)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    If we only know the true God via Jesus Christ, then what is it that we know via our primitive knowledge? 
    Our primitive knowledge is a trace of the true God, but it is not knowledge of the true God.
    This is why general revelation cannot be construed as a way to know the God revealed in Jesus Christ.
    That is a relational God who tells us what He is like and what He has done.
    To know is to encounter.
    And general revelation is not an encounter with the person of God, but at best is an encounter with a philosophical concept of God or an experiential notion of the being of God. 
    Why is that not enough for a firm and rationally confident theism that proves the existence of God logically (see I'm finally coming back around to the title)? 
    Because, as Bonhoeffer says:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        A God who could be proved by us would be an idol
        (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd09jLTcXKI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen D. Morrison quotes it here, but some claim it's spurious - regarless I like it!</a>)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        At best, we can prove the existence of an idol. 
        Therefore, as a Christian, I must be agnostic about the existence of God.
        There is no way to prove the existence of the true God because the true God is only unveiled to us in Jesus Christ.
        The person and work of Jesus Christ is simply not a matter of natural history.
        You can prove the existence of Jesus and His death, maybe get some sort of scholarly consensus on His teachings and that His followers thought He came back from the dead.
        But the actual <i>person</i> of Jesus? Not a historical reconstruction, but really who He is? No, you just can't. It's methodologically impossible to get at a person in history.
        And that's the point of Christian agnosticism.
        You have to be agnostic about epistemic certainty of God's existence (apart from Jesus Christ) because the second you try to do that you will end up with an idol of your own making.
        Your grounding for belief in God will be rooted in philosophical systems or experiental moments or historical reconstructions.
        But the real God is living and active, and is speaking today by His Word Jesus Christ.
        You can't really <i>know</i> God without meeting God and hearing God and responding to God.
        Therefore, at least through my (post?-)Barthian perspective, I must stand firmly on a Christian agnosticism.
