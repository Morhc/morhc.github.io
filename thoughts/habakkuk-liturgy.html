    <h4>A Habakkukian Liturgy</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2024-01-15">January 15, 2024</time></p>

    <p>
        I strongly believe that the book of Habakkuk is the heart of the Hebrew Bible and central to many questions that those of us who hold it as Scripture.
        The book contends with the silence of God and His inaction towards injustice, and the discontent we feel with God's response.
        Habakkkuk's complaints are left standing, and God's action in history feels unjustified.
        I personally find myself on the side of the prophet. Where is God in the violence of the state? Why does He not act?
        Why when He acts does He use means that seem worse than what He is responding to?
        I don't have a resolution either, but below is a liturgy that I wrote to express my discontent and to centralize the questions on the person of Jesus.
        The liturgy was written in 2022 for a discipleship group and partially in response to the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/stó-lō-nation-residential-schools-missing-children-unmarked-burials-1.6974053s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">children in Canadian residential schools</a>,
        but can very easily be adapted to the current struggle of the Palestinian people.
    </p>

    <h4>Week One</h4>
    <p>
        Open with Psalm 113 as a prayer.<br>
        Read Habakkuk from start to finish. Give attention to 2.4, 3.5, and 3.17-19. <br>
        Reflect on Ruth 1.20-21: "God has caused me to suffer and He is my Lord." <br>
        Meditate on Psalm 88 is a prayer in the midst of deep depression and the silence of God. <br>
        Consider: Why is there suffering in this world? Where is God in this suffering? What is He doing? <br>
        Read Colossians 1.15-23, 1 Corinthians 15.20-28, 50-58, 1 John 4.7-21, Hebrews 2.5-18, James 1.27, and 2 Peter 1.3-4. <br>
        Consider: The love of God shown through the death of Christ gives us hope in the midst of our suffering. <br>
        Close with Psalm 111 as a prayer.
    </p>

    <h4>Week Two</h4>
    <p>
        Open with with Psalm 13 as a prayer. <br>
        Read through Job 14 and Ruth 1. The theme in both is that people are suffering and God has caused it. <br>
        Read through Habakkuk 1 and considered each of the sections:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> v.1-4 Habakkuk asks God why He has been silent about the death, destruction and injustice that is happening in Israel. </li>
        <li> v.5-11 God responds to Habakkuk that He is raising up the Babylonian empire to bring more death, destruction, and injustice. </li>   
        <li> v. 12-17 Habakkuk grapples with this answer and is confused why God would choose to act in this way as it doesn't seem to make sense with His Holiness. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Read Mark 1.1-8, Luke 4.18-20, Luke 8.42b-48 and think about who Jesus responds to suffering. <br>
        Read Mark 15-16.8 and consider the darkness that Jesus experienced in His death. <br>
        Read Deuteronomy 4.5-8 and think about how God cares for the well-being of all people. <br>
        Close with Psalm 124 as a prayer
    </p>

    <h4>Week Three</h4>
    <p>
        Open with Psalm 86 as a prayer. <br>
        Read Exodus 33.18-34:8 and consider the nature of God's holiness. <br> 
        Read through Isaiah 59 and God's promise to personally come and solve injustice. <br>
        Read through Habakkuk 2 and considered God's response to the prophet's complaint. 
        Note that the woes are pronouncements against nations, but can also be applied against indivdiuals. <br>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Woe to those who plunder others.</li>
            <ul>
            <li> There are two things identified: human bloodshed (increasing human suffering) and violence to the earth (ecological damages). </li>
            <li> Seeing some parallels with how Canada stole the land from the Indigenous population. </li>
            </ul>
        <li> Woe to those who use evil to profit.</li>
            <ul>
            <li> These people destroyed many on their way to accumulate wealth. </li>
            <li> Seeing some parallels to billionaires who exploit and hurt many people on their way to being rich. </li>
            </ul>
        <li> Woe to those who build cities through bloodshed and evil.</li> 
            <ul>
            <li> Some difficulties to interpret v. 13, but we see a contrast between the futile actions of the nations resulting in nothing and the actions of God filling the earth with His glory. </li>
            <li> Seeing some parallels with the Native genocide and the practice of slavery of Black people in USA and Chinese people in Canada. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Woe to those who exploit.</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Some debate on how to interpret v. 15 : personally see it as people using intoxicants to take advantage of others.</li>
            <li>Parallel in v. 16 between the cup of the Lord pouring out wrath and the cup of the one who makes his neighbour drink pouring out wrath. </li>
            <li> Seeing some parallels with sexual assault and date rape culture on campus and the #MeToo movement. </li>  
            <li> v. 17 and v. 8 contain the same pronouncement against ecological damage and bloodshed. 
                 This is one of the few passages in Scripture that considers sinful actions done to nature.</li>  
            <li> There is special highlighting in v. 17 on the destruction done to animals. </li>
            <li> Seeing some parallels with how factory farming and global warming are causing destruction against animals and the earth & how nations like USA and Canada invaded and destroyed the Middle East for profit. </li>
            </ul>   
        <li>Woe to those who worship idols.</li> 
            <ul>
            <li> The function of idols is to manifest the god behind it to work their power through it. </li>
            <li> God's condemnation here is twofold (and reflected in Jeremiah 10 and Isaiah 40) : (1) you cannot channel the power of the true God through an object and (2) the powers you are invoking are ineffect to save you. </li>
            <li> Seeing some parallels to the idolatry of power and people who say "oh big tech will save us from climate change".</li>
            </ul>

    </ol>
    <p>
        Read Isaiah 55 and see the prophet's imagination of what a perfect world under God looks like. <br>
        Read 1 Peter 1.1-10 as encouragement to walk in the way of Christ. <br>
        Close with Psalm 61 as a prayer.
    </p>

    <h4>Week Four</h4>
    <p>
        Open with Psalm 146 as a prayer. <br>
        Read Habakkuk 3. Interestingly, it is a psalm not contained in the book of Psalms.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> What is v. 8, 10-11 talking about? Habakkuk may be recalling the deeds God did for the nation of Israel in splitting the river Jordan, the Red Sea, and holding the Sun in the sky. </li>
        <li> It's interesting that God is described in war imagery with chariots, bows, and spears. </li>
        <li> v. 13 seems to be a reference to Genesis 3's promise that an offspring  of Eve will crush the head of the serpent, which would make it about Christ. Read Luke 1:46-56 with this in mind. </li>
        <li> Is the third chapter connected to the rest of the book, or just tacked on. The key may be in v. 16 when Habakkuk says he waits for the day God brings judgment.</li>
        <li> Meditate on v. 17-19 and the knowledge that God is our salvation. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Close with Psalm 146 as a prayer.
