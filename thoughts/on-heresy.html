        As a Protestant, the game of calling someone a heretic is a dicey one. 
        If you don't affirm all seven of the universal and ecumenical councils, you cannot properly say you aren't a heretic. 
        Okay, okay, let's lower the bar and say it's someone who denies the Nicene Creed - then Baptists would be heretics for denying “one baptism for the forgiveness of sins”. 
        Okay, okay, let's change it slightly and it's now someone who denies the Apostle's Creed - then it would be okay for someone to deny the divinity and personhood of the Holy Spirit. 
        Fine, then let's say it's someone committed to Scripture as authoritative in their lives - then you cannot exclude Jehovah Witnesses who deny the divinity of Christ.

        Calling someone a heretic boils down most of the time to saying you don't like someone's theology. 
        Unless you are part of the Eastern Orthodox or Roman Catholic Churches, you cannot properly use the word to describe someone who denies the apostolic teachings of the fathers. 
        (There is no universal theology of the fathers btw.)
        Even if you are part of the Orthodox or Catholic Churches, the use of the term heretic is still problematic. 
        To deny the Oriental Orthodox, the Assyrian Church of the East, or the denominations in the Protestant movement as legitimate followers of Jesus with fruit to show for it would be quite ignorant.

        The term heretic functions as a tool to maintain power structures more than anything else. 
        It creates an out-group to the in-group. 
        Certainly there are things that have historically defined what it means to be a Christian, and there are beliefs that do trace back to the apostles, but this alone does not define Christianity. 
        There have been many people in the long history of Church who dissent from these teachings as we understand them today - even Christology (looking at the early subordinationists like Origen and Clement). 
        Calling someone a heretic is to designate that God is against them and that they are condemned to hell.
        This opens the door to exclusion, fear, hatred, and eventually to Inquisitions.

        <blockquote>
            What we call "orthodoxy" and "heresy" are retrospective and (to be honest) transparently ideological constructions - 
            which is to say, <i>reconstructions</i> of what has been - meant to fortify every new doctrinal resolution by enfolding it
            in the misty mythology of some pure and exhaustive deposit of faith wherein all later orthodoxies are always already present,
            like latent algorithms... there is nothing so truly new as our "ancient" traditions.
            <br>- David Bentley Hart, Tradition and Apocalypse

    <p>
        If someone is using the term heretic, think to yourself why they are using that label. 
        How do they define it? By what authority are they exercising it with? 

    </p>
        <blockquote>
            All too often in Christian history, the word "heretic" has been just another word for someone who,
            honestly seeking first the Kingdom of God and its righteousness, has had the misfortune of doing so in a way
            ultimately pronounced defective either by his or her contemporaries or (more contemptibly) by later generations.
            <br>- David Bentley Hart, Tradition and Apocalypse

        I think it is far more helpful to encourage people to follow God as far as you understand Him. 
        For myself, I am a Protestant who is willing to affirm the first six ecumenical councils in their definitions of God as a trinity of persons and Christology as somewhere between St. Cyril and St. Maximus. 
        If someone who labels themselves as a Christian disagrees with me on matters of theology then I will point them to Scripture and the fathers to explain why I think they should agree with me. 
        However, I am more concerned that they follow what God said through Micah:
    </p>

            <blockquote>

            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+6&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micah 6.8</a>: 
            He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, 
            and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God? 

            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                Only in cases of moral depature from the explicit teachings of Christ can one easily identify what one
                can rightly call heresies.
                A professed Christian, for instance, so detached from the teachings of Jesus that he or she is willing
                to argue in favor of capital punishment, or to claim that Christians my blamelessly acquire and keep vast
                personal wealth, or to embrace libertarian social theory, or to support a certain recently unseated Republican
                president of the United States, or to champion right-wing Catholic integralism, and so forth is one who has 
                effectively left the Gospel behind and who may justly be regarded as having abandoned the true tradition altogether.
                <br>- David Bentley Hart, Tradition and Apocalypse
            </blockquote>

        Postscript on evangelical pronouncements. 
        If someone follows another faith tradition, or is completely non-religious, I encourage them when they follow God and point to Jesus Christ as the one who reveals God's character to us. 
        It is not my job to argue people into Christianity as I see fit. 
        I represent Jesus Christ and attest to His teachings by my life, and if that is appealing to someone then God will draw them to Himself.
