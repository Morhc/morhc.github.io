    <h4> Violence and Colonization </h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2024-01-15">January 15, 2024</time></p>

    <p>
        I was reading <a href="https://africasacountry.com/2023/11/the-false-equivalence-of-the-colonized-and-colonizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article</a> about the Palestine-Israel conflict and I was really challenged by my convictions about pacifism.
        There is so much that I agree with in the article:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The violence that the oppressed use to break the chains of the oppressor is nowhere close to equivalent to the violence that the colonizer imposes.</li>
        <li>Malcolm X's desire for peaceful negotiations, but seeing no way for it to be effective.</li>
        <li>Denouncing Palestinian action against state violence is akin to asking them to accept their fate quietly and die.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In fact I don't think that I would formally disagree with anything in the body of the text.
        The situation is beyond clear that solidarity with the Palestinian people is the morally correct position.
        Even before the attacks on October 7th, it was clear that the Israeli government was not interested in peace and had enstated <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an apartheid state</a>.
        Israel is <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/01/11/israel/palestine-unprecedented-killings-repression" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clearly the aggressor</a>, taking severe actions like the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/12/israel-white-phosphorus-used-gaza-lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use of white phosphorous</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-bombs-refugee-camps-central-gaza-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bombing refugee camps</a>.
    </p>

        However, I cannot shake the conviction of pacifism.
        Jesus lived in a time of colonial violence and oppression by the Roman empire and advocated for a non-violent response.
        Judea, Galliee, and Samaria were regions that were occupied by Rome (although not to the devasting militarized extent that Israel and the US have imposed on Palestine).
        There was a militarized resistance movement called the Zealots that advocated for a violent response to the occupation, and although we do not see Jesus directly interacting with them (besides a disciple being a Zealot) His message contrasted theirs.
    </p>
        <blockquote>
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 5.38-44</a>: “You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'
            But I say to you: Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also, 
            and if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, give your coat as well, 
            and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile. 
            Give to the one who asks of you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.
            “You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
            But I say to you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you

        Although this does not directly speak to what to do in the face of violent suppression, Jesus is speaking to the reality of living under military occupation and advocating for a non-violent response.
        Personally, I suspect that the gospel of Matthew is composed after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE and in part is responding to the failures of violent revolt in overthrowing Rome.
        Violence from the oppressed against the oppressor can lead to violent suppression from the state.
        I think Paul is reflecting on the sermon on the Mount when he is writing about a Christian response to the state.
    </p>
        <blockquote>
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 12.19-21</a>: 
            Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, 
            “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord.” 
            Instead, “if your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them something to drink, for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads.” 
            Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
        </blockquote>
    <p> 
        Overcoming evil with good can not happen through violence, even a justified violence of the oppressed.
        However, there is the further complication that I do not think that Christian ethics can be generally extrapolated because they are rooted in the freedom from the fear of death and empowered by the Holy Spirit.
        Despite this, pacifism and meditation on the sermon on the Mount have produced effective results in ending oppression in the recent past.
        Gandhi was <a href="https://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/mahatma-gandhi-and-sermon-on-the-mount.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> inspired by it </a> when leading his resisitance to the British in India, and MLK Jr resonanted with that and led a non-violent black liberation movement.
        Non-violent action was also extremely important to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/161471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">end apartheid in South Africa</a>.

        I have no resolution to this tension. I cannot condemn the response of the Palestinians to the violence of the Israeli state.
        I pray for their liberation and for the end of the occupation.
        God is the God of the oppressed. God identifies with those under imperialism and colonization.
        God is the God of the Palestinian people.
        Peaceful resolution seems impossible when Israel is intent on genociding the Palestinian people <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/netanyahu-israel-hamas-100-days-b2478410.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no matter what</a>.
        I empathize with the desire to fight back against the violence of the state.
        I do not know what I would do if I was in their position.
        But I also beleive that Jesus' way of non-violence is the only way to overcome evil with good.
        Violence begets violence, and although this situation is completely asymmetrical, further violence will not lead to peace.
        Israel has only doubled down on their suppression and devastation of the Palestinian people.
        From the river to the sea, may God make Palestine free.
    </p>
        <blockquote>
            Almighty God, who created us in your own image: Grant us grace fearlessly to contend against evil and to make no peace with oppression; and, that we may reverently use our freedom, help us to employ it in the maintenance of justice in our communities and among the nations, to the glory of your holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.
