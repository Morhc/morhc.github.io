    <h4>Lies of Penal Substitutionary Atonement II</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2025-08-26">August 27, 2025</time></p>

    <p>
        Another day, another lie of penal substitutionary atonement.
        Last time <a href="lies-of-psa-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">we saw that</a> the Bible never uses the language of Jesus paying our debt to God.
        Today I was thinking to myself in the car about something else those who hold to penal substitutionary atonement often say: it is necessary for God to uphold His justice.
        How would God do this?
        Well, the way penal substitution goes, those who know the Law have violated it and therefore are subject to its punishments and those who don't know the Law are subject to the punishments because of some internal sense of morality (established by an appeal to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 2</a>).
        I have no problem with this reading of Romans 2 (well... I mean you can see my greater thoughts on Romans <a href="romans-theodicy.html" class="boxed-link">elsewhere</a>), nor will I contest that it seems that there is a violation of the Law and an expected recompense of justice for that.
        However, Paul actually doesn't say that God <i>must</i> punish sin to uphold His justice.
        In fact, Paul literally sidesteps the Law, and hence any notion of God needing to satisfy His justice.
        The whole of Paul's argument is this:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Because of the trickery of Sin, we are all under a curse of the Law <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 7.7-13</a>.</li>
        <li>As a just God, He must judge all that under Sin by His wrath <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 3.19-20</a>.</li>
        <li>However, God does not want to judge us by His wrath because He loves us <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 5.8</a>.</li>
        <li>Therefore, God in Jesus completely sidesteps the necessity to punish us because of Sin <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 3.21-26</a>.</li>
        <li>This is because Jesus lived a life of perfect faithfulness to God under the Law, but died under the curse of the Law <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Galatians 3.10-14</a>.</li>
        <li>By dying under the curse of the Law, Jesus is set free from the demands of the Law <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 7.1-4</a>.</li>
        <li>He is then raised back to life by God justified as righteous and no longer under the Law, which is justification for those who are united to Him as well <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 4.25</a>.</li>
        <li>If we unite ourselves to Christ by baptism, we will have freedom from Sin and no longer be under the curse of the Law <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 6</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Notice how none of this involves God satisfying His justice by punishing Jesus.
        Paul literally goes way out of His way to establish the lineage of faith as the means of justification as a pre-Law phenomena through Abraham in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 4</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Galatians 3</a>.
        Please just consider the following passages with some light commentary from me.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Galatians 2.15-16, 19-21</a>:
        We ourselves are Jews by birth and not gentile sinners, yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through the faith of Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by doing the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works of the law... For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Commentary: We are justified by Christ's faithfulness to God, not because God punishes Christ to satisfy His justice.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Galatians 3.10-14</a>:
        For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law.” Now it is evident that no one is reckoned as righteous before God by the law, for “the one who is righteous will live by faith.” But the law does not rest on faith; on the contrary, “Whoever does the works of the law will live by them.” Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”— in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Commentary: Christ was cursed by the Law, not punished by God to satisfy His justice.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 3.19-22</a>: 
        Now we know that, whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For no human will be justified before him by deeds prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin. But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been disclosed and is attested by the Law and the Prophets, the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ for all who believe.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Commentary: God has disclosed His righteousness <i>apart</i> from the Law, not by through doling out the punishment required by the Law.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Romans 7.1-4</a>: 
        Or do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law is binding on a person only during that person's lifetime? Thus a married woman is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives, but if her husband dies, she is discharged from the law concerning the husband. Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she belongs to another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she belongs to another man, she is not an adulteress. In the same way, my brothers and sisters, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God.    
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Commentary: We are freed from the curse of the Law by dying with Christ and therefore no longer being subject to it, not because God punishes Christ.
