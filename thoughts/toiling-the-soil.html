        I have spent a lot of time in my life thinking about the opening chapters of Genesis unfortunately.
        I would not say that it has been a pleasure, largely because it was largely a struggle to escape young earth creationism as an astronomer.
        Thank God I am not a young earth creationist anymore and I can read Genesis as myth freely and openly.
        I read Genesis 1-9 the other month for the first time in a while with the basic framework of critical scholarship in mind and wow it is weird how many sources you can clearly see in the text and how much mythological content is plainly in there.
        Anyways, I was really interested in the curse because I saw something that I can't shake.

    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3.14-19</a>: 
        The Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you among all animals and among all wild creatures; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life. 
        I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.”
        To the woman he said, “I will make your pangs in childbirth exceedingly great; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.”
        And to the man he said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
        By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”

        Okay so there is a lot going on here.
        Obviously the Christian reading tradition retrospectively sees this as a proto-evangelion and prophecy that Jesus will conquer the Devil via the crucifixion.
        This is fine, in fact I grant this as a completely valid allegorical interpretation of the text, but since I came from a literalist reading tradition it was always taken as a prophecy said by God to Adam and Eve in history written down verbatim by Moses some 2000 years after the fact.
        Clearly that is not the case because (1) Genesis did not happen in history very plainly (2) Genesis was composed starting in 500 BC at the absolute earliest (3) Genesis is stitched together from multiple sources and traditions very plainly.
        So if you think it is a literal prophecy uttered in history by God to Adam and Eve, you are wrong.
        Anyways, as far as I am aware, the primary understanding of critical-scholarship is that Genesis serves as mythological etiology for the world the ancient Canaanites that became what we would call "Israelites" lived in.
        And the whole conversation about the snake is an etiology for... why snakes are scary and different and kill people.
        And I can totally accept and see that. 
        It seems pretty good to me.
        I just want to think through the possibility that there is some internal expectation for fulfillment of this as prophecy in Genesis 1-9, but us in the Christian tradition have completely missed it because we are so focused on the allegorical fulfillment by Jesus.
        I have no idea if this is commented on in the critical scholarship, but I don't know how to check that.
        Presumably I am not the first person to think of this.
        With that cavaet, let's think about the curse pronounced to Adam as we thinking about Cain and Noah: <b>"And to the man he said... cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return."</b>

        In Genesis 4, we have the story of Cain killing Abel.
        After killing his brother, Cain is cursed by God.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%204&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 4.11-14</a>: 
        And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
        When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”
        Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is greater than I can bear! 
        Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        It seems really, really weird to me that Cain's curse is... the same as Adam's curse.
        And that Cain says it's more than he can bear to be driven away from the soil.
        Arguably it's more tame than Adam's because no thorns or thistles are mentioned.
        But it is the same curse.
        Why is it being repeated and why is Cain so upset about it if narratively it's just a rehash?
        Likely because it's not a rehash for the original form of this story.
        If I had to guess, Genesis 3 and 4 come from different literary strata, both with a similar etiology for why farming is hard work.
        Another reason I think is because Genesis 5 seems to copy the genealogy of Cain from Genesis 4 (which ends at Lamech and chapter 5's copy goes one further with Noah) while rehashing language about the image of God from Genesis 1.
        It makes sense in my head that Genesis 5 is a literary layer that intentionally blends content from Genesis 1 and 4 to append to the separate story of chapters 2-3. 
        (Also as a sidenote to people who say "let Scripture interpret Scripture", it's plainly obvious that Genesis 5.1-3 clearly thinks being made in God's image/likeness means humans are literally made in God's physical appearance. Like straight up these authors clearly thought God had a body - see the work of Francesca Stavrakopoulou).
        Anyways, speaking of Genesis 5, let's flip to the end of the chapter.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%205&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 5.28-29</a>: 
        When Lamech had lived one hundred eighty-two years, he became the father of a son; he named him Noah, saying, “Out of the ground that the Lord has cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        One of the literary additions of the author of Genesis 5 to their copy of chapter 4 is Noah as Lamech's son.
        And Noah is understood to be the one who will bring relief from the toil of the ground that God cursed.
        As in the fulfillment of the curse pronounced to Adam/Cain.
        I honestly have never heard anyone mention this before, but it seems extremely obvious to me that this is the intention of the author of Genesis 5.
        (Now of course the Noah stories are complicated because it looks like there are minimum two different Flood stories and another Noahic story without a Flood that are all stitched together with extra mythological content about Nephilim that hardly coheres.
        Who knows how any of those stories connect to Genesis 1-5, if at all.
        Maybe the author of Genesis 5 is in the middle of these redaction layers and is doing their best to connect the dots between bits of what we now call Genesis 1-4 and 6-9). 
        Look at the end of chapter 8 and really think about the curse of Adam/Cain.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%208&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 8.20-22</a>: 
        Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And when the Lord smelled the pleasing odor, the Lord said in his heart, “I will never again curse the ground because of humans, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done. As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not cease.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Doesn't this sound like a direct fulfillment of Genesis 5.29 that Noah will bring relief from the toil of the ground that God cursed in Genesis 3.17-19/4.11-14? 
        I think it does.
        I think it's a really compelling reading of the text in its original context.
        Compare this also with Genesis 9.1-17 which has a repeat of God saying that He promises not to destroy everything again and clearly uses the language of Genesis 1 about being fruitful and taking dominion over the earth.
        Genesis 9 makes no mention of the curse of the ground, but it does have God vowing "<i>the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh</i>".
        Probably the author of Genesis 5 has Genesis 4 and whatever layers of Genesis 8 for their Flood narrative when they are rewriting Cain's genealogy.
        I also don't think it's a mistake that Noah is a "man of the soil" given the plenary curses.
        Maybe there used to be a story out there about Noah the farmer who is the ancestor of the non-nomadic peoples of ancient Canaan.
    </p>
    <p>
        How did this mess all come around?
        Let's imagine and make up a context for this. 
        Ancient nomadic tribes with stories about their ancestor Cain enter into the land of Israel-Palestine and encounter the peoples there who have stories like the Epic of Gilgamesh and Atrahasis about a great flood and the Baal Cycle about the creation of the world. 
        Egyptian and Mesopotamian mythological stories and traditions are constantly around them, and there is a large diversity of practices and beliefs.
        Then the majority of people who live in the land are killed off by the Assyrian empire, and the rest are exiled to Babylon a couple hundred years later.
        The people who are left in the land, those who are in Babylon, those who ran off to Egypt, and those in the Assyrian north then create unifying stories over the next few hundred years as the Greek empire blossoms.
        Eventually: boom we have the Hebrew Bible and the insane mess of Genesis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every passing day, I figure that the Bible is a lot more inscrutable than I thought it was.
        I literally have no idea how to read the Bible apart from the allegorical tradition because it is so messy and so full of different layers of tradition.
        But, I think it's important to sit and think about the original text because it is so weird and has absolutely nothing to do with anyone today.
        I think it's really clear that intention of the redactors of Genesis 1-9 to create a mythological etiology for the world they lived in.
        And I think that whoever wrote Genesis 5 was convinced that Noah was the relief from the Adam/Cain curse. 
        The text really does portray Noah as the solution to the problem of the curse of the ground.
        And it is not mentioned again ever in the Hebrew Bible.
        I think this is a really overlooked part of the story and worth thinking about.
