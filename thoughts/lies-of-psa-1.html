    <h4>Lies of Penal Substitutionary Atonement I</h4>

        I think it's so funny that penal substitutionary atonement is taken as the default understanding of the work of Jesus Christ and His reconciliation of humanity to God when it is actually just a huge lie.
        I genuinely do not understand how anyone can believe it -- especially those who claim to be Bible believing Christians like many evangelicals.
        This all started years ago when I starting thinking about the wrath of God and how Jesus' death relates to it. 
        Penal substitutionary atonement as a doctrine requires that Jesus is actively punished by the wrath of God so that His justice is satisfied and we can be forgiven.
        However: the Bible never says that Jesus was punished by the wrath of God.
        I felt literally bonkers <a href="https://medium.com/@itsjoshissa/on-gods-wrath-ed80e7a868bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when I clocked that for the first time</a>, but the more I thought about it, the more clear Scriptural language became.
        Rather the language of Scripture, both literal and allegorical, is that Christ covers our sins such that on the day of judgement God's wrath passes by us harmlessly.
        Once this became clear to me, I immediately started to question the whole framework for penal substitution.
        Then last year I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7216089313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lamb of the Free</a> by Andrew Rillera and it blew my mind that even something as basic as substitution was also not found at all within Scriptural language.
        Anyways, it's been bothering me for a while now, so I thought I would write down some of my thoughts on this bad doctrine.

    <p>
        Today's lie of penal substitutionary atonement is that Jesus paid our debt we accrued by sinning to God.
        This is... just not in the Bible.
        Instead, all the times we have the concept of a debt, they are cancelled and forgiven.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 2.13-15</a>: 
        And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, when he forgave us all our trespasses, erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in it.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Like.... I don't know what people want. 
        There is no payment of a sin debt.
        Colossians says it straight up: the debt we had was forgiven and erased.
        Also think about <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 18.21-35</a>: we have a man who owed a king a huge debt, and after the man begs the king just forgives the debt.
        No one pays it. 
        It's just forgiven.
        Now the man fails to forgive his fellow servant and so he is thrown into jail and must pay off his own debt (which is a picture of a temporary hell that is eventually paid off). 
        But Christ uses the parable to explain <i>how</i> we are to forgive others -- so if we are to forgive and forgive and forgive seventy times over and forget the debts that others owe us, then how much more true is it that God forgave us on the cross without a requirement of debt payment?
        Penal substitutionary atonement would actually make God the unforgiving servant, since this is the only man who demands a payment and does not forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
        So why does penal substitutionary atonement even exist?
        And how do evangelical pastors get away with literally citing verses and pretending they support penal substitutionary atonement?
        And why do we have songs like Jesus Paid It All?
        I really have no idea.
        I just think it's really funny that the reading tradition that claims that they read the Bible literally has no single verse in the whole Bible to back up the central doctrine of what Jesus died for.
        They just have this warped, evil doctrine made up in the 16th century by Calvin and developed until the 19th by Hodge and jam verses in to support it when they say the exact opposite.
        Lol.
