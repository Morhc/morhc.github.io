    <h4>Lies of Penal Substitutionary Atonement I</h4>

        I think it's so funny that penal substitutionary atonement is taken as the default understanding of the work of Jesus Christ and His reconciliation of humanity to God when it is actually just a huge lie.
        I genuinely do not understand how anyone can believe it -- especially those who claim to be Bible believing Christians like many evangelicals.
        This all started years ago when I starting thinking about the wrath of God and how Jesus' death relates to it. 
        Penal substitutionary atonement as a doctrine requires that Jesus is actively punished by the wrath of God so that His justice is satisfied and we can be forgiven.
        However: the Bible never says that Jesus was punished by the wrath of God.
        I felt literally bonkers <a href="https://medium.com/@itsjoshissa/on-gods-wrath-ed80e7a868bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when I clocked that for the first time</a>, but the more I thought about it, the more clear Scriptural language became.
        Rather the language of Scripture, both literal and allegorical, is that Christ covers our sins such that on the day of judgement God's wrath passes by us harmlessly.
        Once this became clear to me, I immediately started to question the whole framework for penal substitution.
        Then last year I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7216089313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lamb of the Free</a> by Andrew Rillera and it blew my mind that even something as basic as substitution was also not found at all within Scriptural language.
        Anyways, it's been bothering me for a while now, so I thought I would write down some of my thoughts on this bad doctrine.

        Today's lie of penal substitutionary atonement is that Jesus paid our debt we accrued by sinning to God.
        This is... just not in the Bible.
        Instead, all the times we have the concept of a debt, they are cancelled and forgiven.

    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 18.21-35</a>: 
        Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, if my brother or sister sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven times?” Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times.

        “For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. When he began the reckoning, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him, and, as he could not pay, the lord ordered him to be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions and payment to be made. So the slave fell on his knees before him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.' And out of pity for him, the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. But that same slave, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him by the throat he said, 'Pay what you owe.' Then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you.' But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt. When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. Then his lord summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on you?' And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt. So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”

    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 2.13-15</a>: 
        And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, when he forgave us all our trespasses, erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in it.

        Like.... I don't know what people want. 
        There is no payment of a sin debt.
        Colossians says it straight up: the debt we had was forgiven and erased.
        So why does penal substitutionary atonement even exist?
        And how do evangelical pastors get away with literally citing this verse and pretending like it supports penal substitutionary atonement?
        And why do we have songs like Jesus Paid It All?
        I really have no idea.
        I just think it's really funny that the reading tradition that claims that they read the Bible literally has no single verse in the whole Bible to back up the central doctrine of what Jesus died for.
        They just have this warped, evil doctrine made up in the 16th century by Calvin and developed until the 19th by Hodge and jam verses in to support it when they say the exact opposite.
        Lol.
