    <h4>Slavery Apologetics in the Bible</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2026-02-16">February 16, 2026</time></p>

        I was reading through Judges and realized something pretty gross.
        There is a significant portion of the Bible that is slavery apologetics. 
        Like, the whole point of some texts in the Bible is to justify the enslavement of those who are non-Jewish.

        Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages, but the Canaanites continued to live in that land. When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor but did not in fact drive them out. And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, but the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer. Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol, but the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to forced labor. Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Mahalab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob, but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out. Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth-anath but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them. The Amorites pressed the Danites back into the hill country; they did not allow them to come down to the plain. The Amorites continued to live in Har-heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor. The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.

        The current historical-critical wisdom is that there was no people of Israel coming into Canaan, but rather that slowly people groups distinguished themselves as separate from their neighbours.
        Saying that means that those who invented the fictive kin groups we call the tribes of Israel had to invent why there were those who didn't join together were there.
        One of the answers from Judges is that the genocidal slaughter of the northern bloodthirsty monster Joshua was incomplete.
        So this is describing a collaborative group of tribal cities of significant enough military might conquering and enslaving their neighbours.
        So that sucks.
        And it explains the following story from early in Genesis.

    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209%20&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Genesis 9.18-27</a> 
        The sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan. These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was peopled. Noah, a man of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard. He drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he lay uncovered in his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside. Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness. When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him, he said,<br><br>
        “Cursed be Canaan;
            lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.”<br><br>
        He also said,<br><br>
        “Blessed by the Lord my God be Shem,
            and let Canaan be his slave.
        May God make space for Japheth,
            and let him live in the tents of Shem,
            and let Canaan be his slave.”

        This is a theological argument from the writers, editors, and compilers of Genesis as to why it is totally okay and normal to own slaves (as we saw in Juges 1). 
        Which is literally a biological argument for the "rightness" of enslaving people because they are of a different lineage than you.
        Which is the absolute most disgusting thing that I could ever imagine.
        The text was put together noticeable sloppy by the editors who stitched multiple stories together and messed up that Canaan is not a brother of Shem and Japheth, nor is Ham/Canaan the youngest of Noah. 
        This was a story most likely invented to make people okay with the perpetual systems of slave trade described in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2025&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link"> Leviticus 25.44-46</a>.
        So not only is slavery biblical, so is doing slavery apologetics. Evangelicals rejoice!

        So what are we supposed to do with this. 
        Obviously, we must reject the intent of the authors on moral grounds.
        Maybe we should put ourselves in the shoes of the slave.
        Maybe we should pretend there were outspoken critics of the slave trade and this story was used to censure them.
        Maybe the theological value we glean from Judges and Genesis and Leviticus and wherever else we find slavery apologetics from the ruling class is to continue the fight against slavery.
        That the elites who create the theological mainstream we live in, who want slavery to be the norm, are wrong and we must stand our ground.
        That we must stand with Ham/Canaan and the many inhabitants of the cities in Palestine who were and are oppressed.
