    <h4>Nicene Christianity & Baptism</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2025-05-14">May 14, 2025</time></p>

    <p>
        Nicene Christianity is the closest thing we have to a universal defintion of Christianity.
        The Nicene creed is the most ecumenical statement on the nature of Christian faith and what one must believe.
        The story is that it was written around the time of the Nicene council updated a some 60 years later at the council Constantinople I to flesh out comments on the Holy Spirit.
        Probably not accurate fully but it does show up somewhere in the 300-400s and has been adopted by both West and East.
        You can check out this cool article <a href="https://postbarthian.com/2014/12/30/jurgen-moltmanns-proposed-additions-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from PostBarthian</a> on the limited nature of the creed, but it is useful for defining Christian theology nonetheless.
        What I want to focus on is what it has to say about baptism.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <b>We believe in one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.</b>
    </blockquote>
    <p> 
        Flatly speaking, evangelicals are not Nicene Christians.
        This extends in general to most Baptists, Pentecostals, and non-denominational groups. 
        A lot of these groups are super die-hard on their abberant reading of 1 Peter 3.21 that somehow baptism does not play a salvific role... despite the text saying "<i>baptism now saves you</i>".
        They will say that baptism is only an outward symbol of an inward change and believing that baptism is related at all to the forgiveness of sins is a work-based theology.
        <a href="https://www.gty.org/library/questions/QA79/is-baptism-necessary-for-salvation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is John MacArthur</a> on the subject as an example:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Perhaps the most convincing refutation of the view that baptism is necessary for salvation are those who were saved apart from baptism. 
        The penitent woman (Luke 7:37-50), the paralytic man (Matthew 9:2), the publican (Luke 18:13-14), and the thief on the cross (Luke 23:39-43) all experienced forgiveness of sins apart from baptism. 
        For that matter, we have no record of the apostles' being baptized, yet Jesus pronounced them clean of their sins (John 15:3--note that the Word of God, not baptism, is what cleansed them).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Regardless of the argument itself, it is a clear denial of the Nicene creed.
        If you find yourself in  agreement with MacArthur, you are not a Nicene Christian straight up.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is the additional issue that also evangelicals do not necessarily perform Trinitarian baptisms.
        No prescribed formula is followed by these churches and they often will have a single immersion in the name of the Trinity.
        This is an illegitimate administration of baptism.
        <a href="https://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum02.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Canon 7 of Constantinople I</a> states that:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Those who embrace orthodoxy and join the number of those who are being saved from the heretics, we receive in the following regular and customary manner: 
        Arians, Macedonians, Sabbatians, Novatians, those who call themselves Cathars and Aristae, Quartodeciman or Tetradites, Apollinarians-these we receive when 
        they hand in statements and anathematise every heresy which is not of the same mind as the holy, catholic and apostolic church of God. 
        They are first sealed or anointed with holy chrism on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth and ears. As we seal them we say: “Seal of the gift of the holy Spirit”. 
        <b>But Eunomians, who are baptised in a single immersion</b>, Montanists (called Phrygians here), Sabellians, who teach the identity of Father and Son and make certain other difficulties, 
        and all other sects — since there are many here, not least those who originate in the country of the Galatians — <b>we receive all who wish to leave them and embrace orthodoxy as we do Greeks.
        On the first day we make Christians of them, on the second catechumens, on the third we exorcise them by breathing three times into their faces and their ears, and thus we catechise them and 
        make them spend time in the church and listen to the scriptures; and then we baptise them.</b>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        According to this canon of an ecumenical council, only triple immersion constitues a valid Christian baptism.
        Literally you are not even counted as Christian if you are dipped by a single immersion.
        The various heretical groups mentioned before such as the Arians are considered Christian heretics who have a valid baptism but need to be sealed by chrism, but if you are invalidly baptized by 
        single immersion you have to (1) be made a Christian (2) re-enter catechism class and be re-taught (3) exorcised from demons (4) spend time in church listening to Scripture keep up with catechism (5) be baptized validly.
        This is a pretty big deal if you care at all about what the ecumenical councils have to say about Christianity.
        And if you do not... how do you structure your theology?
        It would not be in communion at all with the history of the church in any meaningful way and instead would be inventing a new religion.
    </p>
    <p>
        So to conclude: if you deny that baptism is for the forgiveness of sins and you were baptized by a single immersion, you are not a Christian according to the historical definitions of the church and are completely out of line with the rulings of the early ecumenical councils.
