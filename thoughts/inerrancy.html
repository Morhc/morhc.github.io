    <h4>We Don't Need Inerrancy</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2024-03-19">March 19, 2024</time></p>

        I was made aware of a review under Randal Rauser's book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Jesus-Loves-Canaanites-Biblical-Intuition/dp/1775046249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Jesus Loves Canaanites</i></a> by a user named Minky.
        Minky has a really thought provoking review, and in it they provide an approach to the Bible that I think is spot-on.

        <blockquote>
            Here is an alternative solution to help struggling Christians and sympathists explain the data without tortured hermeneutical maneuvers. 
            (1) the Bible is not inerrant. (2) It does not need to be. (3) It nevertheless is the Church's (and the world's) inspired, efficacious, and definitive library of theological-historical source material for understanding Jesus, the early church, and their religious ancestors. 
            (4) It remains a vital source for Christian theologizing, provided it is brought into constructive dialogue with other sources of theologizing (e.g., philosophy, ethics, science, historical research).
        </blockquote>

        Honestly, the simplicity of this approach is beautiful. It does away with concerns about inerrancy, inspiration, and the Bible's authority.
        It does not dwell on questions of the "legitimacy" of the canon nor the apostolicity of the texts.
        It just allows us to read the Bible and use it as a tool in our theological toolbox.
        It even allows us to have the Bible as the theological basis for our worldview (if we're careful about it).
        But it does not force. It does not insist. It allows the texts contained in the Bible to speak, and allows us to listen meaningfully and critically.
        In essence, it allows the Bible to be what 2 Timothy 3 says it is: <b>useful</b>.
