    <h4>Adamic Christology & Ecumenical Dialogue</h4>
    <p class="small-text">Posted on <time datetime="2025-11-27">November 27, 2025</time></p>

    <p>
        I have been reflecting recently on Christology, ecumenical dialogue with Islam, and David Bentley Hart's monistic theology.
        An interesting idea I had is that taking the Adamic reading of Philippians 2 (as partly endorsed by David) is a way to express Christian theology in a way that is more palatable to Islamic sensibilities.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        “I think the same angelomorphism is evident in Paul's theology, most especially in the Philippians “hymn.” There is, I realize, some dispute over whether the text there concerns the descent of a celestial divine figure or instead the exaltation of a man; but it seems to me an anachronism to think that some choice must be made between these readings...which I would render as “who, subsisting in a god's form, did not deem existing in the manner of a god a thing to be seized, but instead emptied himself, taking a slave's form, coming to be in a likeness of human beings; and, being found as a human being in shape, he reduced himself, becoming obedient all the way to death, and a death by a cross” (Philippians 2:6-8). Principally, I would note that the obscure phrase τὸ εἶναι ἴσα θεῷ almost certainly has nothing to do with any presumed “equality” (ἰσότης) between the Lord who descended and God the Father on high (ὁ θεός)... And so, on the one hand, I do agree with those who see the phrase as echoing the Septuagintal renderings of Genesis 3:5, καὶ ἔσεσθε ὡς θεοί, and 3:22, γέγονεν ὡς εἷς ἐξ ἡμῶν. I suspect also that the ἁρπαγμός, the “thing to be seized,” of which Paul speaks is an oblique reference to the fruit of the tree of life: μήποτε ἐκτείνῃ τὴν χεῖρα καὶ λάβῃ τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς καὶ φάγῃ (3:22). Christ, so to speak, passed the test that Adam failed.”

        The pivotal passage for all this, of course, is Philippians 2:5-11 which traditionally has been read as referring to the pre-existent Logos, co-equal to the Father, becoming incarnate as Jesus of Nazareth by hiding His divinity. But there have been alternative readings that argue that the passage refers to a human Jesus who does not violate God's will as Adam did (typologically by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil) and instead submits to God completely, and then is honoured by God who translates Him into a god (emphasis on the lowercase 'g') by ascending Jesus into the heavens as a reward for His perfect obedience.
        A recent book that argues that Paul is not looking at a pre-existent divine being in this passage is Andrew Perriman's <i>In the Form of a God</i>.

        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Philippians 2.5-11 (NRSV)</a>:
        Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, who, though he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, assuming human likeness.
        And being found in appearance as a human, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross.
        Therefore God exalted him even more highly and gave him the name that is above every other name, so that at the name given to Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

        The question is then what is meant by "form of <i>a</i> god" (note all popular level Christian translations intentionally incorrectly render the text as "form of God").
        Regardless of what it means, I have been thinking about this phrase and how biblical authors use the Adam typology.
        And then while watching YouTube, it hit me: Ezekiel reads Adam typologically and Isaiah uses the general concept!

        How you are fallen from heaven, O Morning Star, son of Dawn! 
        How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low! You said to yourself, “I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit on the mount of assembly on the heights of Zaphon; I will ascend to the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.” 
        But you are brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the Pit.

        Because your heart is proud and you have said, “I am a god; I sit in the seat of the gods, in the heart of the seas,” yet you are but a mortal and no god, though you compare your mind with the mind of a god... 
        Because you compare your mind with the mind of a god, therefore, I will bring strangers against you, the most terrible of the nations; they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and defile your splendor.
        They shall thrust you down to the Pit, and you shall die a violent death in the heart of the seas.
        Will you still say, “I am a god,” in the presence of those who kill you, though you are but a mortal and no god, in the hands of those who pierce you?
        You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners, for I have spoken, says the Lord God... 
        You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
        You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering...
        You were a cherub; I placed you on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the stones of fire.
        You were blameless in your ways from the day that you were created, until iniquity was found in you...
        you were filled with violence, and you sinned, so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and I drove you out, O guardian cherub, from among the stones of fire.
        Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor.
        I cast you to the ground; I exposed you before kings, to feast their eyes on you.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        While it is obvious that Isaiah and Ezekiel are working with some more mythological form of the Eden story (perhaps some Canaanite myths where Adam was one of the children of El, perhaps they combined some myth with our Genesis myth, and Psalm 88 where YHWH calls out the other gods in the courts of El in similar language), the point in both is that these kings aspired to become like God or called themselves gods so they were judged and brought low.
        Which of course is the Adamic cycle of being high and then brought low for disobedience to God.
        It could be that these passages are also in the background of Paul's composition of Philippians 2, where Jesus does not aspire beyond His rank and is honoured for it (unlike Adam and the kings of Babylon and Tyre).

        Now I think this is all quite plausible, but the interesting question is how this has massive implications for interfaith dialogue with Islam.
        Islam is of course strictly monotheistic and explicitly rejects any notion of the Trinity or the divinity of Jesus.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://quran.com/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Surah An-Nisa Ayah 171</a>: 
        People of the Book, do not go to excess in your religion, and do not say anything about God except the truth: the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was nothing more than a messenger of God, His word, directed to Mary, a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers and do not speak of a 'Trinity' - stop [this], that is better for you - God is only one God, He is far above having a son, everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him and He is the best one to trust.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        However, David Bentley Hart argues quite convincingly in <i>The Light of Tabor</i> that if we want to be philosophically consistent with impassability and the dogmatic Christian claim of an incarnate Logos, we have to accept a monistic view of the world.
        That is, rather than two strictly ontologically distinct substances (divine and non-divine), instead there is a single substance (that which we call the divine) that manifests in limited capacities as created beings.
        Therefore, human beings are gods by definition and are teleologically ordered to divinization.
        But due to our current inability to recognize the divine Logos within ourselves, or perhaps even our resistance to it, we are under the illusion that we are something that is non-divine.
        Jesus from this perspective always had a fully realized understanding that the Logos was His true principle such that there was no dividing line between His individual psyche and the act of the Logos (or as David says: He was <i>transparent </i> to the Logos).
    </p>
    <p>
        Does this open the door for ecumenical dialogue with Islam?
        I think it very well could, if one is willing to shed harder doctrinal lines around how ones speaks of the triply hypostatic God.
        If instead we speak of God, His Messiah who perfectly revealed Him, and His active presence in our community that we call Spirit, then I think we can do this.
        I don't know personally how open Islam is to monistic theology and divinization, but I think it is worth exploring.
        Especially because under this lens, Philippians 2 says that Jesus becomes recognized as a god by God by His full submission to God's will, which we are to emulate.
        And in Islam, being submitted to God's will is the whole story.

    <blockquote>
        <a href="https://quran.com/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Surah Al-Baqarah Ayah 130-132</a>: 
        Who but a fool would forsake the religion of Abraham? We have chosen him in this world and he will rank among the righteous in the Hereafter.
        His Lord said to him, 'Devote yourself to Me.' Abraham replied, 'I devote myself to the Lord of the Universe,'
        and commanded his sons to do the same, as did Jacob: 'My sons, God has chosen [your] religion for you, so make sure you devote yourselves to Him, to your dying moment.'

        Of course Islam is very strict in the Qu'ran of separating God from His creation, so who knows if they would accept any level of monism.
        But, there is are glimmer of hopes in (1) the Sufi tradition where many mystics express the doctrine of fanā' [union with God by annhiliation of the self by full submission] and (2) Ibn Arabi's doctrines of waḥdat al-wujūd [a monistic doctrine of the unity of Being] and Al-Insān al-kāmil [the perfect man who is bound with both the human and divine].
        I mean just read how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Arabi"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">Wikipedia</a> talks about Al-Isān al-kāmil:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        God's essence is seen in the existent human being, as God is the object and human beings the mirrors. This means two things: that since humans are mere reflections of God there can be no distinction or separation between the two and, without God, the creatures would be non-existent. When an individual understands that there is no separation between human and God they begin on the path of ultimate oneness. The one who decides to walk in this oneness pursues the true reality and responds to God's longing to be known. The search within for this reality of oneness causes one to be reunited with God, as well as improve self-consciousness.
        The perfect human, through this developed self-consciousness and self-realization, prompts divine self-manifestation. This causes the perfect human to be of both divine and earthly origin... He contemplated the Logos, or "Universal Man", as a mediation between the individual human and the divine essence.
        Ibn Arabi regarded Muhammad as the primary example of the perfect man, embodying the moral attributes of God.
        He believed that the first entity brought into existence was the reality or essence of Muhammad (al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya), considered the master of all creatures and a central model for human emulation. According to Ibn Arabi, God's attributes and names are manifested in the world, with their most complete and perfect expression found in Muhammad. He asserted that one could perceive God through the reflection of Muhammad, maintaining that Muhammad served as the clearest proof of God and that by knowing Muhammad, one could come to know God.
    </blockquote>

        I mean... come on. That's like almost Chalcedonian language there.
        You have (pre-existent!, perfect!, without separation!) union between divine and human in a single hypostasis that is the Logos made manifest in time as a prophetic human being that reveals God. 
        Now of course this Logos is Muhammad and is not eternally begotten (although all is created by this Logos), but if people are willing to make concessions we can totally do this.
        Concession 1: Christians have to be willing to accept that Muhammad is a true prophet of God. Concession 2: Muslims have to be willing to accept an eternally begotten Logos (in an Ibn Arabi sense). Concession 3: Both have to be willing to accept a monistic ontology. Concession 4: Both have to be willing that the Logos can and was fully manifested in both Jesus and Muhammad.
        If that happens, not only can ecumenical dialogue happen, but full theological synthesis can happen.
        Which would be really cool to see.

        Now some people might balk at the idea of a pluralist theology that synthesizes Christianity and Islam. 
        But worry not to those people: David Bentley Hart already started synthesizing with Vedāntic Hinduism, and this probably can easily be extended to Judiaism via some mystic or Kabbalistic tradition.
        <i>Lowkey, I imagine this ends up in a form of Baha'i theology. LOL.</i> 
        Anyways anyways anyways. 
        If you are persuaded by any of monistic theology and religious synthesis, I think this is a really interesting path to explore.
