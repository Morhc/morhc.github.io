    <h1> BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS</h1>

    <p>
        I really enjoy reading. Probably my only hobby.
        My reading habits are mostly informed by my desire to live in a more equitable world and learning what I can do to contribute to that.
        My understanding of what that means is filtered through a Christian lens that is Presbyterian-leaning and has an eye towards liberation theology.
        God is the God of the oppressed, and as a Christian I feel a duty to care for the vulnerable in my local context as well as I can.

            If you want a copy of any of these books, I would ask that you don't order from Amazon because they are evil <a href="https://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/books/12043"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boxed-link">[see here]</a>.
            Almost all books can be found at the library, locally run bookstores, secondhand, online, or through the publisher's website.
